## Grid Table Design

The foundation of the MinMax99 system is a grid-based representation of the Earth's surface, enabling precise spatial indexing and efficient data retrieval. This section explains the grid's construction, its hierarchical structure, and the rationale behind its design.

---

### **2.1 Earth's Dimensions and Grid Resolution**
- **Earth's Surface Dimensions:**
    - Approximate equatorial circumference: **40,075 km (40,075,000 m)**.
    - Approximate pole-to-pole distance: **20,000 km (20,000,000 m)**.

- **Grid Cell Resolution:**
    - Each cell represents an area of **500 m x 500 m**, chosen to balance precision with scalability.
    - Total area per cell: **250,000 m²**.

---

### **2.2 Grid Structure**

The MinMax99 grid divides the Earth's surface into a structured layout for efficient spatial indexing.

---

#### **Rows and Columns**
- **Columns**:  
  (Earth's width / Cell size = 40,075,000 m / 500 m = 82,000)

- **Rows**:  
  (Earth's height / Cell size = 20,000,000 m / 500 m = 42,000)

---

#### **Total Grid Cells**
The total number of cells in the grid:  
82,000 columns × 42,000 rows = 3,444,000,000 cells

---

#### **Sequential Cell Numbering**
- Cells are assigned unique IDs, starting from **top-left** to **bottom-right** in a **column-major order**:
    - Cell \(0\): Top-left corner (\(x = 0, y = 0\)).
    - Cell \(3,444,000,000\): Bottom-right corner (\(x = 81,999, y = 41,999\)).

---

#### **Example: Cell Numbering Table**
| **Row/Column** | **0**          | **1**          | **2**          | **...**        | **81,999**     |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **0**          | Cell 0         | Cell 42,000    | Cell 84,000    | ...            | Cell 3,441,999 |
| **1**          | Cell 1         | Cell 42,001    | Cell 84,001    | ...            | Cell 3,442,000 |
| **2**          | Cell 2         | Cell 42,002    | Cell 84,002    | ...            | Cell 3,442,001 |
| **...**        | ...            | ...            | ...            | ...            | ...            |
| **41,999**     | Cell 41,999    | Cell 83,999    | Cell 125,999   | ...            | Cell 3,444,000 |


### **2.3 Hierarchical Node Structure**
To optimize scalability and querying, the grid is divided into hierarchical levels:

1. **Level 1 (Top-Level Nodes):**
    - Represents groups of **1 million cells each**.
    - Number of nodes at this level: ⌈3,444,000,000 / 1,000,000⌉ = 3,444

2. **Level 2 (Intermediate Nodes):**
    - Represents groups of **1,000 cells each** within each Level 1 node.

    - Number of nodes per Level 1 group:  1,000. 

3. **Level 3 (Leaf Nodes):**
    - Represents the individual cells at the finest granularity.

---

### **Advantages of the Grid Design**
1. **Scalability:**
    - Supports billions of cells with minimal computational overhead.

2. **Efficient Querying:**
    - Hierarchical structure allows rapid narrowing of search space:
        - **Top-Level Node → Intermediate Node → Individual Cell.**

3. **Logical Grouping:**
    - Provides logical separation for data organization and storage.

4. **Compatibility with Firebase:**
    - Hierarchical paths align with Firebase’s real-time database structure, ensuring fast data access.  

## 3. Mathematical Basis

The MinMax99 system relies on mathematical operations to map geo-coordinates to grid cells, assign unique identifiers, and determine spatial relationships efficiently.

---

### **3.1 Mapping Geo-Coordinates to Grid Cells**
Geo-coordinates (latitude and longitude) are converted into grid cell coordinates using the Earth's dimensions and the defined cell resolution.

The key constants used in these calculations are:
- `EARTH_WIDTH_METERS`: Approximate equatorial circumference (40,075,000 m).
- `EARTH_HEIGHT_METERS`: Approximate pole-to-pole distance (20,000,000 m).
- `CELL_SIZE_METERS`: Cell resolution (500 m).
- `NUM_COLUMNS`: Calculated as `EARTH_WIDTH_METERS / CELL_SIZE_METERS` (82,000).
- `NUM_ROWS`: Calculated as `EARTH_HEIGHT_METERS / CELL_SIZE_METERS` (42,000).

#### **Latitude and Longitude to Meters**
- Convert longitude (\`λ\`) to the x-coordinate in meters:

x = (λ + 180) × (EARTH_WIDTH_METERS / 360)

- Convert latitude (\`φ\`) to the y-coordinate in meters:

y = (EARTH_HEIGHT_METERS / 2) - ln(tan(π / 4 + φ × π / 360)) × (EARTH_HEIGHT_METERS / 2π)


#### **Meters to Cell Coordinates**
- Determine the column (\`x_cell\`):

x_cell = floor(x / CELL_SIZE_METERS)

- Determine the row (\`y_cell\`):

y_cell = floor(y / CELL_SIZE_METERS)


---

### **3.2 Cell Numbering**

Each grid cell is assigned a unique numeric ID based on its **column-major order**:

Cell ID = x_cell × NUM_ROWS + y_cell


---

#### **Example:**
- **Latitude**: `12.971598`, **Longitude**: `77.594566` (approx. Bengaluru, India).
- **Step 1**: Convert geo-coordinates to meters:

x = 26,689,774 m, y = 9,458,465 m

- **Step 2**: Convert meters to cell coordinates:

x_cell = floor(26,689,774 / 500) = 53,379 y_cell = floor(9,458,465 / 500) = 18,916

- **Step 3**: Calculate Cell ID:

Cell ID = (53,379 × 42,000) + 18,916 = 2,241,938,716

### **3.3 Neighbor Relationships**

The MinMax99 system identifies neighboring cells by offsetting the row (\(y_{\text{cell}}\)) and column (\(x_{\text{cell}}\)) indices of the central cell.

---

#### **Formulas for Neighboring Cells**
1. **Top Neighbor**:

Cell ID_top = (x_cell × NUM_ROWS) + (y_cell - 1)

2. **Bottom Neighbor**:

Cell ID_bottom = (x_cell × NUM_ROWS) + (y_cell + 1)


3. **Left Neighbor**:

Cell ID_left = ((x_cell - 1) × NUM_ROWS) + y_cell

4. **Right Neighbor**:

Cell ID_right = ((x_cell + 1) × NUM_ROWS) + y_cell


---

#### **Example:**
- **Central Cell**:  
  Cell ID = `2,241,938,716` (from previous calculation).

**Coordinates**:

x_cell = 53,379, y_cell = 18,916


- **Neighboring Cells**:
1. **Top Neighbor**:
   ```
   Cell ID_top = (53,379 × 42,000) + (18,916 - 1) = 2,241,938,715
   ```

2. **Bottom Neighbor**:
   ```
   Cell ID_bottom = (53,379 × 42,000) + (18,916 + 1) = 2,241,938,717
   ```

3. **Left Neighbor**:
   ```
   Cell ID_left = ((53,379 - 1) × 42,000) + 18,916 = 2,241,896,716
   ```

4. **Right Neighbor**:
   ```
   Cell ID_right = ((53,379 + 1) × 42,000) + 18,916 = 2,241,980,716
   ```

---

### **3.4 Distance Calculations**

The distance between two cells is approximated using the differences in their row and column indices:

#### **Formula**

Distance (in meters) = sqrt((Δx × CELL_SIZE_METERS)² + (Δy × CELL_SIZE_METERS)²)


Where:
- \( \Delta x = |x_{\text{cell1}} - x_{\text{cell2}}| \)
- \( \Delta y = |y_{\text{cell1}} - y_{\text{cell2}}| \)

---

#### **Example**
- **Cell 1**:
  x_cell1 = 53,379, y_cell1 = 18,916

- **Cell 2**:
  x_cell2 = 53,380, y_cell2 = 18,917

**Step 1**: Calculate differences in indices:

Δx = |53,379 - 53,380| = 1 Δy = |18,916 - 18,917| = 1

**Step 2**: Apply the formula:

Distance = sqrt((1 × 500)² + (1 × 500)²) = sqrt(250,000 + 250,000) = sqrt(500,000) ≈ 707.11 meters


## 4. Data Structures

The MinMax99 spatial database uses a combination of hierarchical and flat data structures to achieve efficient data storage and retrieval. This section explains the design and advantages of these structures.

---

### **4.1 Flat Data Structure**
The flat structure organizes data directly by cell numbers, minimizing lookup complexity and ensuring fast access.

#### **Structure Overview**
Each cell number serves as a unique key, with associated data stored directly under it. For example:

store_stats/ <cell_number>/ <store_id>: { "isOpen": true, "updatedAt": "2024-10-26T14:00:00Z" } <store_id>: { "isOpen": false, "updatedAt": "2024-10-26T13:00:00Z" }

## 4. Data Structures

The MinMax99 spatial database combines hierarchical and flat data structures for efficient storage and retrieval. This section outlines the corrected structure based on the three-level hierarchy and flat storage strategy.

---

### **4.1 Flat Data Structure**
The flat structure organizes data directly by cell numbers, enabling fast lookups for frequently accessed items.

#### **Structure Overview**
Each cell number serves as a unique key, with associated data stored directly under it. For example:

store_stats/ <cell_number>/ <store_id>: { "isOpen": true, "updatedAt": "2024-10-26T14:00:00Z" } <store_id>: { "isOpen": false, "updatedAt": "2024-10-26T13:00:00Z" }


#### **Advantages**
1. **Fast Access**:
    - Direct lookup of data by cell number avoids multi-level traversal.

2. **Scalability**:
    - Handles millions of store entries efficiently.

3. **Lightweight**:
    - Optimized for operations requiring real-time responses.

---

### **4.2 Hierarchical Node Structure**
The hierarchical structure logically partitions the dataset into progressively smaller groups, ensuring scalability.

#### **Structure Overview**
The hierarchy divides the grid as follows:
1. **Level 1 (Top-Level Nodes)**:
    - Represents groups of 1,000,000 cells, identified by \( \lfloor \text{cell_number} / 1,000,000 \rfloor \).
    - Example: For `cell_number = 2,241,938,716`, Level 1 = `2241`.

2. **Level 2 (Intermediate Nodes)**:
    - Represents groups of 1,000 cells within each top-level group, identified by \( \lfloor (\text{cell_number} / 1,000) \mod 1,000 \rfloor \).
    - Example: For `cell_number = 2,241,938,716`, Level 2 = `938`.

3. **Level 3 (Leaf Nodes)**:
    - Represents the individual cells, identified by \( \text{cell_number} \mod 1,000 \).
    - Example: For `cell_number = 2,241,938,716`, Level 3 = `716`.

---

#### **Firebase Path Example**
For `cell_number = 2,241,938,716`, the hierarchical path is:


#### **Advantages**
1. **Fast Access**:
    - Direct lookup of data by cell number avoids multi-level traversal.

2. **Scalability**:
    - Handles millions of store entries efficiently.

3. **Lightweight**:
    - Optimized for operations requiring real-time responses.

---

store_data/ 2241/ 938/ 716/ <store_id>: { "name": "Store A", "inventory": { ... } }


---

#### **Advantages**
1. **Efficient Querying**:
    - Reduces search space by narrowing down from Level 1 to Level 3.

2. **Logical Partitioning**:
    - Simplifies data management and avoids overloading flat structures.

3. **Firebase Compatibility**:
    - Well-suited for Firebase’s hierarchical design, enabling seamless data retrieval.

---

### **4.3 Choosing the Right Structure**
MinMax99 strategically uses both structures:
- **Flat Data**:
    - Best for high-frequency operations like store availability checks.
- **Hierarchical Nodes**:
    - Ideal for scalable storage and operations involving multiple data points.


## 5. Algorithm Implementation

This section describes the core algorithms used in the MinMax99 system, including mapping geo-coordinates to cell numbers, constructing hierarchical database paths, and identifying neighboring cells.

---

### **5.1 Geo to Cell Number**
This algorithm converts geo-coordinates (latitude and longitude) into a unique cell number based on the grid.

#### **Pseudocode**
```java
function geoToCellNumber(latitude, longitude):
    EARTH_WIDTH_METERS = 40,075,000 // Earth's circumference in meters
    EARTH_HEIGHT_METERS = 20,000,000 // Earth's height in meters
    CELL_SIZE_METERS = 500 // Cell size in meters
    NUM_ROWS = 42000 // Number of rows in the grid

    // Convert longitude to x in meters
    xMeters = (longitude + 180) × (EARTH_WIDTH_METERS / 360)
    // Convert latitude to y in meters
    yMeters = (EARTH_HEIGHT_METERS / 2) - ln(tan(π / 4 + latitude × π / 360)) × (EARTH_HEIGHT_METERS / (2π))

    // Calculate cell coordinates
    xCell = floor(xMeters / CELL_SIZE_METERS)
    yCell = floor(yMeters / CELL_SIZE_METERS)

    // Compute cell number (column-major order)
    return (xCell × NUM_ROWS) + yCell

```
Example
Latitude: 12.971598, Longitude: 77.594566 (Bengaluru, India).
Step 1: Convert geo-coordinates to meters:

x = 26,689,774 m, y = 9,458,465 m

Step 2: Convert meters to cell coordinates:

xCell = floor(26,689,774 / CELL_SIZE_METERS) = 53,379

yCell = floor(9,458,465 / CELL_SIZE_METERS) = 18,916

Step 3: Calculate Cell ID:

Cell ID = (53,379 × NUM_ROWS) + 18,916 = 2,241,938,716

5.2 Constructing Firebase Paths
This algorithm generates a hierarchical path for a given cell number.

Pseudocode
```java
function constructDbPath(cellNumber, nodeName):
LEVEL1 = floor(cellNumber / 1,000,000) // Top-level node
LEVEL2 = floor((cellNumber / 1,000) % 1,000) // Intermediate node
LEVEL3 = cellNumber % 1,000 // Leaf node

    return LEVEL1 + "/" + LEVEL2 + "/" + LEVEL3 + "/" + nodeName
```

Example
Cell Number: 2,241,938,716, Node Name: "store_data".

Firebase Path: 2241/938/716/store_data

5.3 Finding Neighboring Cells
This algorithm identifies neighboring cells based on a given precision.

Pseudocode
```java
function getNeighboringCells(cellNumber, precision):
CELL_SIZE_METERS = 500 // Grid cell size in meters
distance = floor(precision / CELL_SIZE_METERS) // Convert precision to cell units

    // Convert cell number to x, y coordinates
    xCell = floor(cellNumber / NUM_ROWS)
    yCell = cellNumber % NUM_ROWS

    neighbors = []

    // Iterate over neighboring cell range
    for dx in range(-distance, distance + 1):
        for dy in range(-distance, distance + 1):
            neighborX = xCell + dx
            neighborY = yCell + dy

            // Skip out-of-bounds neighbors
            if neighborX < 0 or neighborX >= NUM_COLUMNS or neighborY < 0 or neighborY >= NUM_ROWS:
                continue

            // Calculate neighbor cell number
            neighborCell = (neighborX × NUM_ROWS) + neighborY
            neighbors.append(neighborCell)

    return neighbors


```

Example
Cell Number: 2,241,938,716
Precision: 1000m²
Neighboring Cells:

[2,241,937,716, 2,241,939,716, 2,241,938,715, 2,241,938,717, ...]

---

### **5.4 Layer-Based Cell Retrieval**
This section explains algorithms for retrieving cells based on "layers." In this context, a layer signifies a concentric square region around a central cell, with each layer stepping outwards at 5-kilometer intervals. This method is distinct from finding all cells within a precise radial distance (as in section 5.3) and is useful for queries where stepped, square-shaped regions are more appropriate.

#### **Finding All Cells Within N Layers (`calculateCellsInLayers`)**
This algorithm finds all cell IDs within a specified number of layers from an initial cell.

##### **Pseudocode**
```java
function calculateCellsInLayers(initialCellID, layerNumber):
    // Assumes constants: NUM_ROWS, NUM_COLUMNS, CELL_SIZE_METERS
    // A "layer" here represents a 5000-meter step.

    x_cell = floor(initialCellID / NUM_ROWS)
    y_cell = initialCellID % NUM_ROWS

    // Convert layerNumber to a range in cell units
    // Each layer adds 5000m. Cell size is CELL_SIZE_METERS.
    // So, number of cell units for the step is 5000 / CELL_SIZE_METERS
    layer_step_in_cells = 5000 / CELL_SIZE_METERS
    max_offset_in_cells = layerNumber * layer_step_in_cells

    neighboringCellIDs = new List()

    for dx_step from -max_offset_in_cells to max_offset_in_cells step layer_step_in_cells:
        for dy_step from -max_offset_in_cells to max_offset_in_cells step layer_step_in_cells:
            // Optional: Skip the initial cell itself if dx_step and dy_step are both 0
            // if dx_step == 0 AND dy_step == 0:
            //     continue

            newX = x_cell + dx_step
            newY = y_cell + dy_step

            if newX >= 0 AND newX < NUM_COLUMNS AND newY >= 0 AND newY < NUM_ROWS:
                neighboringCellID = newX * NUM_ROWS + newY
                neighboringCellIDs.add(neighboringCellID)

    return neighboringCellIDs
```

#### **Finding Cells on the Perimeter of a Specific Layer (`calculatePerimeterCellsOfLayer`)**
This algorithm finds cell IDs that are specifically on the perimeter of a given layer number.

##### **Pseudocode**
```java
function calculatePerimeterCellsOfLayer(initialCellID, layerNumber):
    // Assumes constants: NUM_ROWS, NUM_COLUMNS, CELL_SIZE_METERS
    // A "layer" here represents a 5000-meter step.

    x_cell = floor(initialCellID / NUM_ROWS)
    y_cell = initialCellID % NUM_ROWS

    layer_step_in_cells = 5000 / CELL_SIZE_METERS
    max_offset_in_cells = layerNumber * layer_step_in_cells

    layerCellIDs = new List()

    // Iterate to find cells at the perimeter of the square defined by max_offset_in_cells
    for dx_step from -max_offset_in_cells to max_offset_in_cells step layer_step_in_cells:
        for dy_step from -max_offset_in_cells to max_offset_in_cells step layer_step_in_cells:
            // Include only if it's on the border of the square layer
            if abs(dx_step) == max_offset_in_cells OR abs(dy_step) == max_offset_in_cells:
                newX = x_cell + dx_step
                newY = y_cell + dy_step

                if newX >= 0 AND newX < NUM_COLUMNS AND newY >= 0 AND newY < NUM_ROWS:
                    layerCellID = newX * NUM_ROWS + newY
                    layerCellIDs.add(layerCellID)

    return layerCellIDs
```

---

### **5.5 Determining Relative Cell Position**
This algorithm determines the relative position of a target cell with respect to a reference cell (e.g., North, South-East, Same Cell). This is useful for understanding spatial relationships between two points on the grid.

#### **Pseudocode**
```java
function determineRelativePosition(referenceCellID, targetCellID):
    // Assumes constants: NUM_ROWS

    // Convert referenceCellID to coordinates
    x_ref = floor(referenceCellID / NUM_ROWS)
    y_ref = referenceCellID % NUM_ROWS

    // Convert targetCellID to coordinates
    x_target = floor(targetCellID / NUM_ROWS)
    y_target = targetCellID % NUM_ROWS

    // Determine direction
    // Note: Assuming (0,0) is top-left.
    // Increasing y means moving South. Increasing x means moving East.

    if x_ref == x_target AND y_ref == y_target:
        return "Same Cell"
    else if x_ref == x_target:
        if y_target > y_ref:
            return "South" // Or "Bottom" if preferred for pure cardinal
        else:
            return "North" // Or "Top"
    else if y_ref == y_target:
        if x_target > x_ref:
            return "East" // Or "Right"
        else:
            return "West" // Or "Left"
    else:
        verticalDirection = ""
        if y_target > y_ref:
            verticalDirection = "South"
        else:
            verticalDirection = "North"

        horizontalDirection = ""
        if x_target > x_ref:
            horizontalDirection = "East"
        else:
            horizontalDirection = "West"

        return verticalDirection + "-" + horizontalDirection // e.g., "North-East"
```

#### **Explanation of Output**
The function returns a string indicating the relative position:
- **"Same Cell"**: If the reference and target cells are identical.
- **Cardinal Directions**: "North", "South", "East", "West" if the target cell is directly along one of these axes relative to the reference cell.
- **Diagonal Directions**: Combined strings like "North-East", "South-West", etc., for cells that are diagonally positioned.

Efficiency
Direct Lookups: Single-cell queries are instantaneous due to numeric ID indexing.
Regional Queries: Efficiently identify and query neighboring cells using the hierarchical structure.
Scalability: Algorithms handle billions of cells with minimal computational overhead

## 6. Querying and Optimization

The MinMax99 system ensures efficient spatial data retrieval through well-structured queries and strategic optimizations. This section explains how queries are performed and optimized for scalability and performance.

---

### **6.1 Efficient Querying**

#### **Single-Cell Query**
- Directly retrieves data for a specific cell number.
- Example:
    - Firebase Path:
      ```
      store_stats/<cell_number>/<store_id>
      ```
    - Query retrieves:
      ```
      { "isOpen": true, "updatedAt": "2024-10-26T14:00:00Z" }
      ```

#### **Regional Query**
- Retrieve data from multiple cells in a region:
    1. Use `geoToCellNumber` to determine the central cell.
    2. Use `getNeighboringCells` to calculate neighboring cells based on precision.
    3. Perform parallel queries for all relevant cells.

---

### **6.2 Precision-Based Queries**

#### **Adjusting Query Precision**
- Precision determines the range of neighboring cells to include:
    - **500 m² precision**: Query only the center cell.
    - **1000 m² precision**: Include the center cell and its direct neighbors.
    - **Larger regions**: Expand the range to include additional layers of neighbors.

#### **Example: 1000 m² Precision Query**
- **Central Cell**: `2,241,938,716`
- **Neighbors**:

[2,241,937,716, 2,241,939,716, 2,241,938,715, 2,241,938,717, ...]

- Query all these cells to retrieve data for the region.

---

### **6.3 Optimizations**

#### **Hierarchical Querying**
- Use hierarchical paths to narrow the search space:
- **Level 1**: Identify the relevant top-level node.
- **Level 2**: Refine to the intermediate node.
- **Level 3**: Access individual cell data.

#### **Indexing**
- Leverage Firebase indexing for faster lookups:
- Index paths by `cell_number` or `updatedAt` fields for real-time queries.

#### **Caching**
- Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., store statuses) locally to reduce redundant queries.

#### **Parallel Queries**
- Perform asynchronous queries for regional searches to improve response times:
- Example: Query 10 neighboring cells simultaneously using multi-threading.

---

### **6.4 Scalability Strategies**

#### **Flat Structure for High-Frequency Queries**
- Use the flat structure for quick lookups like store availability checks.

#### **Hierarchical Structure for Bulk Queries**
- Employ hierarchical nodes for larger operations, such as fetching data for multiple regions.

#### **Optimized Data Updates**
- Update only relevant cells and users based on their spatial proximity to the change.

---

### **Performance Highlights**
1. **Single-Cell Query Time**: Near-instantaneous due to direct lookup by cell number.
2. **Regional Query Efficiency**: Scales logarithmically with the size of the queried region.
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Combines WebRTC for real-time updates and Firebase for infrequent but necessary database interactions.

#### **Scenario**
- A user’s location: **Latitude** = `12.971598`, **Longitude** = `77.594566`.

#### **Steps**
1. **Convert Geo-Coordinates to Meters**:  

x = (77.594566 + 180) × (40,075,000 / 360) = 26,689,774 m y = (20,000,000 / 2) - ln(tan(π / 4 + (12.971598 × π / 360))) × (20,000,000 / (2π)) = 9,458,465 m


2. **Convert Meters to Cell Coordinates**:  

x_cell = floor(26,689,774 / 500) = 53,379 y_cell = floor(9,458,465 / 500) = 18,916


3. **Calculate the Cell Number**:  

Cell ID = (53,379 × 42,000) + 18,916 = 2,241,938,716


---

### **7.2 Querying Store Availability**
#### **Scenario**
- Querying for the store status in cell `2,241,938,716`.

#### **Steps**
1. **Firebase Path**:  
   store_stats/2,241,938,716/<store_id>


2. **Retrieved Data**:  
   { "isOpen": true, "updatedAt": "2024-10-26T14:00:00Z" }


---

### **7.3 Regional Query for Nearby Stores**
#### **Scenario**
- The user wants to find all nearby stores within a **1000m² precision** region.

#### **Steps**
1. **Identify Neighboring Cells**:  

Center Cell ID = 2,241,938,716 Precision = 1000m² Neighbors = [2,241,937,715, 2,241,937,716, 2,241,937,717, 2,241,938,715, ...]


2. **Query Firebase**:  
   Perform parallel queries for each cell in the list:  

store_stats/<cell_number>/<store_id>


3. **Consolidate Results**:  
   Combine responses into a unified list of stores, filtering based on criteria (e.g., `isOpen = true`).

---

### **7.4 Constructing a Firebase Path**
#### **Scenario**
- Storing inventory data for a store in cell `2,241,938,716`.

#### **Steps**
1. **Cell Number Hierarchy**:  

Level 1 = floor(2,241,938,716 / 1,000,000) = 2241 Level 2 = floor((2,241,938,716 / 1,000) % 1,000) = 938 Level 3 = 2,241,938,716 % 1,000 = 716

### **7.5 Distance Calculation Between Two Stores**
#### **Scenario**
- Store 1 in `2,241,938,716`.
- Store 2 in `2,241,939,717`.

#### **Steps**
1. **Extract Coordinates**:  

x1 = floor(2,241,938,716 / 42,000) = 53,379 y1 = 2,241,938,716 % 42,000 = 18,916

x2 = floor(2,241,939,717 / 42,000) = 53,379 y2 = 2,241,939,717 % 42,000 = 18,917


2. **Calculate Differences**:  

Δx = |53,379 - 53,379| = 0 Δy = |18,916 - 18,917| = 1


3. **Compute Distance**:  

Distance = sqrt((Δx × 500)² + (Δy × 500)²) = sqrt(0² + 500²) = 500 meters
