The MinMax99 system relies on mathematical operations to map geo-coordinates to grid cells, assign unique identifiers, and determine spatial relationships efficiently.
---
<h3 id="3-1-mapping-geo-coordinates-to-grid-cells">3.1 Mapping Geo-Coordinates to Grid Cells</h3>
Geo-coordinates (latitude and longitude) are converted into grid cell coordinates using the Earth's dimensions and the defined cell resolution.

The key constants used in these calculations are:
- `EARTH_WIDTH_METERS`: Approximate equatorial circumference (40,075,000 m).
- `EARTH_HEIGHT_METERS`: Approximate pole-to-pole distance (20,000,000 m).
- `CELL_SIZE_METERS`: Cell resolution (500 m).
- `NUM_COLUMNS`: Calculated as `EARTH_WIDTH_METERS / CELL_SIZE_METERS` (82,000).
- `NUM_ROWS`: Calculated as `EARTH_HEIGHT_METERS / CELL_SIZE_METERS` (42,000).
<h4 id="latitude-and-longitude-to-meters">Latitude and Longitude to Meters</h4>
- Convert longitude (\`Œª\`) to the x-coordinate in meters:

x = (Œª + 180) √ó (EARTH_WIDTH_METERS / 360)

- Convert latitude (\`œÜ\`) to the y-coordinate in meters:

y = (EARTH_HEIGHT_METERS / 2) - ln(tan(œÄ / 4 + œÜ √ó œÄ / 360)) √ó (EARTH_HEIGHT_METERS / 2œÄ)

<h4 id="meters-to-cell-coordinates">Meters to Cell Coordinates</h4>
- Determine the column (\`x_cell\`):

x_cell = floor(x / CELL_SIZE_METERS)

- Determine the row (\`y_cell\`):

y_cell = floor(y / CELL_SIZE_METERS)

---
<h3 id="3-2-cell-numbering">3.2 Cell Numbering</h3>
Each grid cell is assigned a unique numeric ID based on its **column-major order**:

Cell ID = x_cell √ó NUM_ROWS + y_cell

---
<h4 id="example">Example:</h4>
- **Latitude**: `12.971598`, **Longitude**: `77.594566` (approx. Bengaluru, India).
- **Step 1**: Convert geo-coordinates to meters:

x = 26,689,774 m, y = 9,458,465 m

- **Step 2**: Convert meters to cell coordinates:

x_cell = floor(26,689,774 / 500) = 53,379 y_cell = floor(9,458,465 / 500) = 18,916

- **Step 3**: Calculate Cell ID:

Cell ID = (53,379 √ó 42,000) + 18,916 = 2,241,938,716
<h3 id="3-3-neighbor-relationships">3.3 Neighbor Relationships</h3>
The MinMax99 system identifies neighboring cells by offsetting the row (\(y_{\text{cell}}\)) and column (\(x_{\text{cell}}\)) indices of the central cell.
---
<h4 id="formulas-for-neighboring-cells">Formulas for Neighboring Cells</h4>
1. **Top Neighbor**:

Cell ID_top = (x_cell √ó NUM_ROWS) + (y_cell - 1)

2. **Bottom Neighbor**:

Cell ID_bottom = (x_cell √ó NUM_ROWS) + (y_cell + 1)

3. **Left Neighbor**:

Cell ID_left = ((x_cell - 1) √ó NUM_ROWS) + y_cell

4. **Right Neighbor**:

Cell ID_right = ((x_cell + 1) √ó NUM_ROWS) + y_cell

---
<h4 id="example">Example:</h4>
- **Central Cell**:  
  Cell ID = `2,241,938,716` (from previous calculation).

**Coordinates**:

x_cell = 53,379, y_cell = 18,916

- **Neighboring Cells**:
1. **Top Neighbor**:
   ```
   Cell ID_top = (53,379 √ó 42,000) + (18,916 - 1) = 2,241,938,715
   ```

2. **Bottom Neighbor**:
   ```
   Cell ID_bottom = (53,379 √ó 42,000) + (18,916 + 1) = 2,241,938,717
   ```

3. **Left Neighbor**:
   ```
   Cell ID_left = ((53,379 - 1) √ó 42,000) + 18,916 = 2,241,896,716
   ```

4. **Right Neighbor**:
   ```
   Cell ID_right = ((53,379 + 1) √ó 42,000) + 18,916 = 2,241,980,716
   ```
---
<h3 id="3-4-distance-calculations">3.4 Distance Calculations</h3>
The distance between two cells is approximated using the differences in their row and column indices:
<h4 id="formula">Formula</h4>
Distance (in meters) = sqrt((Œîx √ó CELL_SIZE_METERS)¬≤ + (Œîy √ó CELL_SIZE_METERS)¬≤)

Where:
- \( \Delta x = |x_{\text{cell1}} - x_{\text{cell2}}| \)
- \( \Delta y = |y_{\text{cell1}} - y_{\text{cell2}}| \)
---
<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
- **Cell 1**:
  x_cell1 = 53,379, y_cell1 = 18,916

- **Cell 2**:
  x_cell2 = 53,380, y_cell2 = 18,917

**Step 1**: Calculate differences in indices:

Œîx = |53,379 - 53,380| = 1 Œîy = |18,916 - 18,917| = 1

**Step 2**: Apply the formula:

Distance = sqrt((1 √ó 500)¬≤ + (1 √ó 500)¬≤) = sqrt(250,000 + 250,000) = sqrt(500,000) ‚âà 707.11 meters

<h2 id="4-data-structures">4. Data Structures</h2>

    - Example: For `cell_number = 2,241,938,716`, Level 2 = `938`.

3. **Level 3 (Leaf Nodes)**:
    - Represents the individual cells, identified by \( \text{cell_number} \mod 1,000 \).
    - Example: For `cell_number = 2,241,938,716`, Level 3 = `716`.

    - Ideal for scalable storage and operations involving multiple data points.

<h2 id="5-algorithm-implementation">5. Algorithm Implementation</h2>
This section describes the core algorithms used in the MinMax99 system, including mapping geo-coordinates to cell numbers, constructing hierarchical database paths, and identifying neighboring cells.
---
<h3 id="5-1-geo-to-cell-number">5.1 Geo to Cell Number</h3>
This algorithm converts geo-coordinates (latitude and longitude) into a unique cell number based on the grid.
<h4 id="pseudocode">Pseudocode</h4>
```java
function geoToCellNumber(latitude, longitude):
    EARTH_WIDTH_METERS = 40,075,000 // Earth's circumference in meters
    EARTH_HEIGHT_METERS = 20,000,000 // Earth's height in meters
    CELL_SIZE_METERS = 500 // Cell size in meters
    NUM_ROWS = 42000 // Number of rows in the grid

    // Convert longitude to x in meters
    xMeters = (longitude + 180) √ó (EARTH_WIDTH_METERS / 360)
    // Convert latitude to y in meters
    yMeters = (EARTH_HEIGHT_METERS / 2) - ln(tan(œÄ / 4 + latitude √ó œÄ / 360)) √ó (EARTH_HEIGHT_METERS / (2œÄ))

    // Calculate cell coordinates
    xCell = floor(xMeters / CELL_SIZE_METERS)
    yCell = floor(yMeters / CELL_SIZE_METERS)

    // Compute cell number (column-major order)
    return (xCell √ó NUM_ROWS) + yCell
```
Example
Latitude: 12.971598, Longitude: 77.594566 (Bengaluru, India).
Step 1: Convert geo-coordinates to meters:

x = 26,689,774 m, y = 9,458,465 m

Step 2: Convert meters to cell coordinates:

xCell = floor(26,689,774 / CELL_SIZE_METERS) = 53,379

yCell = floor(9,458,465 / CELL_SIZE_METERS) = 18,916

Step 3: Calculate Cell ID:

Cell ID = (53,379 √ó NUM_ROWS) + 18,916 = 2,241,938,716

5.2 Constructing Firebase Paths
This algorithm generates a hierarchical path for a given cell number.

Pseudocode
```java
function constructDbPath(cellNumber, nodeName):
LEVEL1 = floor(cellNumber / 1,000,000) // Top-level node
LEVEL2 = floor((cellNumber / 1,000) % 1,000) // Intermediate node
LEVEL3 = cellNumber % 1,000 // Leaf node

    return LEVEL1 + "/" + LEVEL2 + "/" + LEVEL3 + "/" + nodeName
```

Example
Cell Number: 2,241,938,716, Node Name: "store_data".

Firebase Path: 2241/938/716/store_data

5.3 Finding Neighboring Cells
This algorithm identifies neighboring cells based on a given precision.

Pseudocode
```java
function getNeighboringCells(cellNumber, precision):
CELL_SIZE_METERS = 500 // Grid cell size in meters
distance = floor(precision / CELL_SIZE_METERS) // Convert precision to cell units

    // Convert cell number to x, y coordinates
    xCell = floor(cellNumber / NUM_ROWS)
    yCell = cellNumber % NUM_ROWS

    neighbors = []

    // Iterate over neighboring cell range
    for dx in range(-distance, distance + 1):
        for dy in range(-distance, distance + 1):
            neighborX = xCell + dx
            neighborY = yCell + dy

<h3 id="5-4-layer-based-cell-retrieval">5.4 Layer-Based Cell Retrieval</h3>
This section explains algorithms for retrieving cells based on "layers." In this context, a layer signifies a concentric square region around a central cell, with each layer stepping outwards at 5-kilometer intervals. This method is distinct from finding all cells within a precise radial distance (as in section 5.3) and is useful for queries where stepped, square-shaped regions are more appropriate.

<h4 id="explanation-of-output">Explanation of Output</h4>
The function returns a string indicating the relative position:
- **"Same Cell"**: If the reference and target cells are identical.
- **Cardinal Directions**: "North", "South", "East", "West" if the target cell is directly along one of these axes relative to the reference cell.
- **Diagonal Directions**: Combined strings like "North-East", "South-West", etc., for cells that are diagonally positioned.
